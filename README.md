## Compiling from Source

Triton is still a premium plugin and if you're going to use it,
it's advised that you purchase it from Spigot or Polymart, as stated above.  
Nevertheless, you're still free to compile it yourself if you have the skills to do so.  
No support will be given to self-compiled versions.

To compile, clone this repository and run the following command:

```sh
./gradlew shadowJar
```
